				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We are proud to announce that the JUSTDOINGIT team is collaborating with the Ontario Association of Food Banks (OAFB) to launch #HUNGERWEEK (May 5-9).</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We are extremely excited to be releasing a powerful photo &amp; video series throughout the week that will raise awareness to hunger in Canada. I encourage everyone to engage and take it all in.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When I signed up for this project, I was very oblivious to who actually used food banks. My initial idea was to do a series on homeless people. I was in shock when OAFB went on to tell me that only 0.4% of all food bank users in Canada are homeless! Really?! First off, why aren&#8217;t homeless people using food banks and then secondly, who actually uses them then?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Well, 40% of food bank users are actually children under 18. What? That means while I grew up in school worrying about my test the next day and what grade I am going to get, a few of my peers beside me were worrying about where their next meal was coming from. It&#8217;s no wonder they could never achieve the grades I did. My grades and my parents&#8217; financial support eventually got me through university and now on to the real world where I fortunately run my own company. But those children never even had a chance at the life I live because they didn&#8217;t have the luxury to worry about grades, they were HUNGRY!</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I find it crazy how as a society we go on to divide people into social classes and take pride in being in the middle &#8211; upper class. We drive nice cars, have great jobs, live in healthy and loving families, and we attribute this &#8220;success&#8221; to our hard work and dedication compared to people in lower classes (who we think made poor decisions in life). To the contrary, this stat tells me that some people will NEVER have the opportunity to live this life, no matter what decisions they make. When a child needs to legitimately worry about how to fuel their body so it doesn&#8217;t drop, how is a test, assignment, or exam supposed to feel relevant. Only amplifying the situation is the fact that our teachers a) don&#8217;t have enough manpower to accommodate for every students&#8217; unique situation (1:35 teacher to student ratio), and b) aren&#8217;t paid enough to care, frankly.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">For the children, once some of my student peers, that persevere and make it to post secondary education; they fight even higher odds of making it through. Did you know there is a food bank or social assistance program in every university/college in Canada!! I went to the University of Waterloo and in my last year I was made aware of this huge room full of food that students could claim anonymously. And I remember questioning the student clerk how many people actually use this room. She directed my eyes to the the clipboard in front of her that showed over 100 students that came by that day. I didn&#8217;t mention that this was only at 2pm, did I?&#8230; Disbelief</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After finding all this out, I wish I could say the conventional thought that people are where they are because of their own good/bad decision making is a reality. That reality is far better than children having a forced hand in how their life will turn out. Ultimately, hunger is a very prevalent and a very REAL issue in Canada and we need to bring more awareness to it so we can create better systems to ensure ALL Canadians have equal opportunities to live the lives they want and DESERVE.</span></strong></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I&#8217;m SUPER EXCITED to be shooting a new video series called #7DAYS!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The series will highlight how it feels to be in another person&#8217;s shoes for 7 days. Sometimes we aren&#8217;t able to empathize with people due to social stigmas, authority-relationships, and/or stereotypes, and I hope this series will shatter those barriers.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I want people to see people as people, not as homeless, not as doctors, not as policemen. Seeing people as people, we can understand why they do the things they do and then we can better manage how we interact with them.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&#8220;Homeless people&#8221; are people, who just so happen to live on the street. And I think we should treat them like people; people who have names, people we can converse with, people that have talents, people we can learn from. One thing that hurts me a lot is when we give leftover food to homeless people. We think they could use it rather than throwing it out, but let me ask you this, how would you feel if someone gave you their leftovers? It&#8217;s degrading and shapes the way these people look and feel about themselves. Its not our fault, however, because society has conditioned us to ignore these people and write them off as nothing beyond being &#8220;homeless&#8221;. This video series will hopefully transform that mindset.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So as you might have guessed, the first video will be about people that live on the streets.. &#8220;homeless people&#8221;.</span></span></p>
