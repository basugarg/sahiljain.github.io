Sometimes we aren&#8217;t able to empathize with people due to social stigmas, authority-relationships, and/or stereotypes, and I hope this series will shatter those barriers.

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The series will highlight how it feels to be in another person&#8217;s shoes for 7 days. Sometimes we aren&#8217;t able to empathize with people due to social stigmas, authority-relationships, and/or stereotypes, and I hope this series will shatter those barriers.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I want people to see people as people, not as homeless, not as doctors, not as policemen. Seeing people as people, we can understand why they do the things they do and then we can better manage how we interact with them.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&#8220;Homeless people&#8221; are people, who just so happen to live on the street. And I think we should treat them like people; people who have names, people we can converse with, people that have talents, people we can learn from. One thing that hurts me a lot is when we give leftover food to homeless people. We think they could use it rather than throwing it out, but let me ask you this, how would you feel if someone gave you their leftovers? It&#8217;s degrading and shapes the way these people look and feel about themselves. Its not our fault, however, because society has conditioned us to ignore these people and write them off as nothing beyond being &#8220;homeless&#8221;. This video series will hopefully transform that mindset.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So as you might have guessed, the first video will be about people that live on the streets.. &#8220;homeless people&#8221;.</span></span></p>
