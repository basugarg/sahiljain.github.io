        <h1 class="page-header">First Term at Waterloo</h1>
        <h3><small><em>January 3rd, 2014</em></small></h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          To start off, I thought I would talk about my first term experience with professors, lectures, and workload in Software Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had the following 6 courses:

                  <p>
                    This course was taught by Charles Clarke, a former SE director, and an accomplished consultant in the industry. He helped developed Bing for Microsoft, and brought his search experience into the course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This course was entirely in the C programming language, but no programming knowledge is necessary. This course starts with the basics: data types, variable declarations, if statements, loops, arrays, and input/output (printf() and scanf()). We then covered functions, recursion, sorting algorithms, fixed-point iteration, Euclid's GCF and bisection algorithms, and Google's page-sorting algorithm, Page Rank. We also covered pointers, string functions, structs, dynamic memory, unicode, and Big-O notation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Having some prior programming experience, I found the pace of this course to be fairly slow. I like more of a challenge, rather than reviewing what I already know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We were given weekly assignments, and a total of three quizzes throughout the term. The midterm exam was 10 questions long, equally weighted, and every question required a coded solution, except one which was short answer. The final exam was 25 questions long, with a similar format. All in all, I enjoyed this course.

                  This course covered general engineering practices, software development lifecycles, workplace ethics, co-op fundamentals, intellectual property laws, and basic statistics. This course was taught by Krzysztof Czarnecki, and although the content was interesting, I found his lectures to be very slow and dry. The lectures were two hours long, twice a week, and each lecture was taught through a slideshow. I found myself quickly losing focus, and would recommend taking notes to stay attentive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although there weren't weekly assignments or a midterm/final exam, I found the workload for this course pretty heavy. There were four quizzes to study for (worth 12.5% of your final mark!), case study reports to write, and the final project to work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For our final project we received the Scribbler 2 Robot at the beginning of the term and we formed groups of seven. The robot comes with some basic sensors such as a camera, line sensor, and IR obstacle sensor. The robot connects wirelessly to your computer, and it's programmed in Python. We were given the initial task of programming the robot to drive straight and avoid obstacles along the way. For the final task, we had to come up with our own problem, solve it with the robot, and write a full technical report.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, although I found the lectures a little too dry, I enjoyed the course because we learned practical concepts and we were able to apply our learning while working as a team.

                  This course is very different from my other courses and from high school. Rather than learning the science behind circuits, or even their application, we simply performed a mathematical analysis on the circuits that were given.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  This course was taught by Andrew Kennings, and I found his lectures to be very structured: each one built on the knowledge of the last. Because of this, it was really easy to fall behind, especially when there are no weekly assignments to make you study.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I found the content of each lecture to be a little challenging, because the pace was fast. I liked that the lectures were only 50 minutes long, and every Friday they would alternate between a lab and a CDT (Computer-Guided Tutorial). I found the labs to be somewhat unrelated to what we were learning, but it was nice to practice building circuits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The course started with voltage, current, resistance, power, and Ohm's law. We then covered Kirchhoff’s laws and circuit analysis techniques such as nodal and mesh analysis. We discussed source transformation, Thévenin and Norton equivalents, op-amps and capacitors/inductors. Finally, we solved AC circuits using complex numbers and phasors. This may seem like a lot to cover in one term, but we didn't go into the physics behind these topics, we simply used them to solve circuits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our midterm and final exam solely consisted of solving a few circuits, but the process of solving a circuit is lengthy, and it's easy to make a mistake. I went about solving them very slowly, and thankfully, I didn't make any mistakes on the midterm, and very few on the final.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Overall, I found this course to be a bit challenging, because this course requires a lot of your attention inside and outside of lectures. I would suggest reviewing notes from the lecture daily, and possible solving a circuit or two on your own after class.

                  This course was taught by the great Firas Mansour, an excellent professor in my opinion. I found him to be knowledgeable, entertaining and understanding. His lectures were open: he would write a couple questions on the board, give us time to solve them and then teach us how to solve them.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Before the midterm, the topics that we covered were mostly a review of grade 12 physics. We covered kinematics, forces and motion, energy, momentum, and pulleys. After the midterm we covered rotation and rolling, statics, simple harmonic motion, and waves and oscillations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were given weekly quizzes and online assignments, and because of these, I was keeping up with the lectures and reviewing every night. Mansour helped write the textbook for this course, and as such, it was very useful. It comes as a bundle of two textbooks (the second book is for ECE 106), and a web-key for the online assignments. This bundle is essential for the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This course is infamous for making its midterm and final exams <em>very hard</em>. Mansour sets the average for the midterm to be 55, simply to scare the class into studying hard for the final. Despite his harsh attitude, he said that he doesn’t expect anyone to fail the course in our SE class. This course was fairly challenging, and I would recommend giving it a lot of your attention outside of class!

                  This course was taught by Eddie Dupont, another excellent professor, who was also very funny! His lectures were very organized, entertaining, and included a lot of words (rather than just equations and formulae). I found that the lectures moved at a comfortable pace, and Eddie explained everything very clearly and slowly.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  We started off by reviewing the definition and inverse of functions, and composite/odd/even functions. We covered piecewise defined functions (such as the Heaviside function), and partial fraction decomposition. We covered trig functions and identities, and we moved onto differentiation. This included optimization, curve sketching, and anti-derivatives. This led into integration, and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Near the end of the course, we covered separable differential equations, polar graphs, complex numbers, and Euler’s formula.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We were given weekly assignments, which I found to be very challenging and time-consuming. However, these assignments forced me to review the lectures and help me overall. Tutorials for this class are designed for one-on-one help and TA’s are always available.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The midterm and final exam were lengthy but straightforward. There weren’t any obscure or trick questions; however, there are many details to memorize.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, this course was enjoyable, and I am looking forward to Calculus 2 next term.

                  This course was taught by Rasha Kashef. I found the concepts for this course to be very abstract, intriguing, but also fairly challenging. I quickly realized while making notes for this class, important information was being missed. I began to just listen to the lecture and later take notes from the detailed textbook. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Before midterms, this course covered geometry of vectors, subspaces and spanning sets, matrices and linear mappings, and geometric mappings. I found that some of this was review for my other classmates, but the linear algebra I covered in high school was very minimal. After midterms we dived into more difficult concepts such as cofactor matrices, Cramer’s rule, Eigenvectors and eigenvalues, diagonalization, orthonormal bases, and general vector spaces. We finished the course with complex numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This course had weekly assignments and quizzes which helped me stay on track. I found the quizzes to be very difficult in comparison to the midterm and final exam. The final exam was surprisingly straightforward; I expected a lengthy and convoluted exam, but because the exam covered so many topics, each question was short and simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, I enjoyed this course because it required me to think abstractly.

<h2>University Lifestyle</h2>
<br>
<p>
  On an average day, I had around 6-7 hours of class, and 2-3 hours of homework after class. Having 6 courses, I had an assignment or lab due every day of the week. Aside from these, I didn’t spend much time looking through notes and doing questions from the textbooks on my own.
</p>
<p> 
  I decided to take notes for every class by hand on loose-leaf paper, and later organize them into binders. I found that taking notes took away some of my attention during lectures, so near the end I stopped taking notes.
</p>
<p>
  Living away from home requires you to be more responsible and look after yourself. I live in UWP with three other guys, and we share the chores pretty well. My room is very small, and with a desk, chair, and bed, there isn’t much space to walk. This term, I didn’t focus enough on my health; I didn’t eat or sleep as well as I hoped to. I opted for the largest meal plan, and barely put a dent in it by the end of the term. This was because many of my meals came from the plaza across the street. 
</p>
<p>
  In terms of marks, I think I did pretty well this term! I was focused while studying for my finals, and had a structured study regime for each course. I would recommend doing as many past exams as possible (which can be found on the EngSoc exam bank), and noting down the type of questions you answer incorrectly. Also, don’t waste time doing questions you already know. These questions build your confidence, which may cause you to lose your studying motivation. Before studying, I felt scared, and rather than try to calm myself down, I used this fear to drive me to work hard.
</p>
<p>
  In total, I enjoyed my first term, having been surrounded by experienced professors and driven peers.
